NUMEDIG presentations
========

This folder contains the material for my presentations at [NUMEDIG](http://www.tjeconomics.com/numedig/) at the University of Copenhagen. So far, I have given the following presentations:

1. [Introduction to `R` programming](http://sebastianbarfort.github.io/R-intro/)
2. A workflow for slides and papers

The best way to see the slides is probably by cloning this repo. 

If you have any comments please get [in touch](mailto:sebastianbarfort@gmail.com).
